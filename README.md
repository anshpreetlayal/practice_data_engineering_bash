## Getting Started: Shell Basics

Embark on your journey to mastering essential Bash shell commands. This guide covers fundamental operations and concepts, empowering you to navigate the command line with confidence.

## `pwd`: Print Working Directory

Now, let's explore the first command in our repertoire.

The `pwd` command, short for "Print Working Directory," is a Unix-like operating system command (including Linux and macOS) used to display the current working directory.

When you execute the `pwd` command, it prints the full path of the current directory to the terminal.

```bash
pwd
````

## `ls` Command: Listing Directory Contents

The `ls` command is a powerful tool for listing the contents of a directory. Here are some common usage examples:

```bash
# List content of the home directory
ls ~

# List directory files in detail
ls -l

# Show hidden files (files starting with a dot)
ls -a

# List hidden files in detail
ls -al

# Sort directory by size
ls -lS

# List all directories
ls -d */
```

Feel free to explore additional options and functionalities by referring to the manual:
```bash
man ls
```

## `cd` Command: Change Directory

The `cd` command in the shell is a versatile tool for navigating the file system. It is used to display the name of the current working directory or to change the current directory. Here are some common use cases:

```bash
# Change to the Root Directory:
cd /

# Go to the home directory
cd ~

# Go back one directory/folder
cd ..

# Go to a specific directory or use an absolute path
cd [directory/folder name]

# Navigate to a file within a directory
cd Directoryname/Filename/

# Open a file with spaces using any of these three options
cd My\ Books
cd "My Books"
cd 'My Books'
```


## `cat` Command
The `cat` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to concatenate and display the content of files. It is a versatile command that can be used for various purposes related to file manipulation.

## Basic Syntax

```bash
cat [options] [filename(s)]
```

```bash
# Display content of a file
cat filename

#Concatenate and display the content of multiple files.
cat file1 file2

#Combine the content of files and redirect the output to a new file.
cat file1 file2 > newfile

# Display content with line numbers
cat -n filename

# Display content with line numbers, ignoring empty lines
cat -b filename
ansh@Xubuntu:~$ cat -b hello.txt
     1  hello cat
     2  spike
     3  legal
     4  nana
     5  dazai

cat -n hello.txt = adds numbers to all the linesin a file even if ithas line breaks
ansh@Xubuntu:~$ cat -n hello.txt
     1  hello cat
     2  spike
     3  legal
     4  nana
     5
     6  dazai

  cat > test.txt =  I/O Redirection works in Linux, Redirect all output to file    
   cat >> test.txt = to appened to a existing content to a file

   cat filename1 filename2 > newfile.txt = to put together content of two files in a new one

   cat filename1 >> filename2 = to append from filename 1 to filename2

## `mkdir` command
The `mkdir` command in Linux/Unix is used to create directories (folders). 
 Basic Syntax:
mkdir [options] directoryname

```bash
Create a Single Directory
   mkdir directoryname

Create Multiple Directories
   mkdir directory1 directory2 directory3

Create a Directory with Parent Directories
   mkdir -p parentdirectory/child1/child2
#   The `-p` option is used to create parent directories along with the specified directory.

Create Nested Directories
   mkdir -p top/level/subdirectory
#   This command creates a nested directory structure with the `-p` option.
```

## `Rmdir` and `RM`  Command
`rmdir` Command:
The `rmdir` command is used to remove empty directories. If a directory contains files, `rmdir` alone may not be sufficient. In such cases, you might need to use `rm` to remove the directory and its contents.
Basic syntax:
rmdir directoryname

```bash
#Remove a Single Empty Directory
rmdir dirname

#Remove a Directory Structure
rmdir -p a/b/c
#The `-p` option removes the specified directory structure along with parent directories if they become empty. In this example, it removes the directory structure "a/b/c."

# Display Extended Information
rmdir -pv a/b/c/d/e
#The `-pv` option displays extended information while removing the directory structure "a/b/c/d/e." It shows the step-by-step removal process.
```

## `rm` Command:
The `rm` command is a versatile command used for removing files and directories. The `-r` option removes a directory and its contents recursively. Use it with caution, as it can delete entire directory structures.
basic syntax:
rm filename/directoryname

```bash
# Remove a File:
rm filename

# Remove a Directory and its Contents:
rm -r directoryname

# Prompt Before Overwriting:
rm -i directoryname/*
#The `-i` option asks for confirmation before removing each file in the directory. It provides an additional layer of safety.

#Remove a Non-Empty Directory:
rm -r directoryname

#This command removes a non-empty directory and its contents. Be cautious, as it can delete files and subdirectories.
```

## `cp` command
 The `cp` command in Linux/Unix is used to copy files and directories from one location to another. 
 Basic Syntax:
cp [options] source destination

 ```bash
#Copy a File to Another File:
  cp filename1 filename2
  # This command makes a copy of `filename1` and names the copy `filename2`.

#Copy a File to a Directory
  cp filename directoryname
#   This command copies `filename` into the specified directory.

#Avoid Overwriting (Prompt for Confirmation)
   cp -i filename filename2 directoryname
  
   #The `-i` option prompts for confirmation before overwriting existing files. It's useful to prevent accidental overwrites.

#Copy a Directory and Its Contents Recursively
cp -R sourcedir destinationdir
  # The `-R` option is used to copy directories and their contents recursively.
  
#Copy a file into a directory
 cp document.txt /path/to/directory/


#Copy a directory and its contents to another location
cp -R source_directory/ /path/to/destination/


#Copy a file with confirmation before overwriting
cp -i important_file.txt backup/
 

#Copy multiple files into a directory
cp file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt /path/to/directory/
  ```

## `mv` command
The `mv` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to move or rename files and directories.
 Its basic syntax is as follows:
mv [OPTION] source destination

```bash
# Move the contents of a file to create a new file
mv filename1 filename2 

# Move a file to a specific directory
mv filename directoryname/

# Move a file to a directory that already has a file with a similar name but different content. The 'mv' command overwrites the existing file with the new one. Use the '-i' flag to prompt for permission before overwriting.
mv -i filename directory

# Move all contents from one directory to another
mv directory1/* directory2

#Move Multiple Files to a Directory
mv file1 file2 file3 /path/to/destination/

#Move and Rename a Directory
mv olddirectory newdirectory

#Move a File to the Home Directory
mv filename ~

#to explore more usages for mv command
man mv
```

## `less` command
The `less` command is a terminal pager program used to view the contents of a text file in a scrollable and interactive way. It is commonly employed for navigating through large files without loading the entire content into memory. less provides more features compared to the traditional more command, allowing users to move both forward and backward through the file, search for specific text, and perform other actions.

Here are some key features of the less command:

```bash
Paging through Text:

You can use the arrow keys, spacebar, and the 'b' key to move forward and backward through the file.
Search Functionality:

touch filename

#Create Multiple Files
touch file1 file2 file3

#Update Timestamp of an Existing File
touch -c filename

#Create Files in a Specific Directory
touch /path/to/directory/filename

# Change the timestamp of the file
touch filename
```

## `nano` command
The nano command is a simple and user-friendly text editor for Unix-like operating systems. It operates in the terminal and is designed to be accessible to users who may not be familiar with more complex text editors like Vim or Emacs. Here are some common usages of the nano command:

```

# `sudo` command
The `sudo` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to execute commands with elevated privileges. 
It stands for "superuser do" and is often required when performing actions that require administrative or root-level access.
 The basic syntax of the sudo command is:
 sudo [options] command [arguments]

```bash
# Run commands with administrator privileges; for example, to create a new directory in an existing directory
ansh@Xubuntu:/etc$ mkdir newdir
mkdir: cannot create directory â€˜newdirâ€™: Permission denied
ansh@Xubuntu:/etc$ sudo mkdir newdir
[sudo] password for ansh: 
ansh@Xubuntu:/etc$ 

# Enter superuser mode
sudo -s

#Install a package using apt-get (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install packageName

#Edit a system configuration file using a text editor (e.g., nano)
sudo nano /etc/config-file.conf

```

# `top` command
The `top` command is a system monitoring utility in Unix-like operating systems that provides real-time information about system performance. When you run the top command in a terminal, it displays a dynamic, interactive view of processes and resource usage. 

```bash

#Press 'n' to filter by process name: Enter a process name to display only matching processes.

```

# `Kill` command
The `kill` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to terminate or send signals to processes.
 The basic syntax of the kill command is:
 kill [signal] PID
signal: Specifies the signal to be sent. If not specified, the default signal is SIGTERM (terminate). 
You can use numeric signal values or signal names (e.g., TERM for termination, HUP for hang up, KILL for forceful termination).
PID: Specifies the Process ID of the target process.

```bash
# Get the PID of a process
pidof processname

#Send the default signal (SIGTERM) to a process
kill PID

#Send a specific signal (e.g., SIGKILL) to a process
kill -9 PID

#Send a signal to multiple processes
kill -15 PID1 PID2 PID3

# To find out the list of running processes
ps -ux

#Send a signal to all processes in a process group.( You can find the Process Group ID (PGID) using the ps command.)
kill -TERM -<PGID>

#Sending SIGKILL (kill -9) is a forceful termination, and the process won't have an opportunity to perform cleanup actions. It should be used cautiously, especially when a more graceful termination (e.g., SIGTERM) is sufficient.
#Always exercise caution when using the kill command, as terminating processes abruptly may lead to data loss or other unexpected behavior.
```

# `Echo` command
The `echo` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to display messages or variables on the terminal.
 Its basic syntax is:
 echo [options] [string(s)]

```bash
#Print a simple string
echo "Hello, World!"

#Print the value of a variable
myvar="cat"
echo "My variable is $myvar"

#Display text without a newline character (useful for appending to a line)
echo -n "This is on the same line"

#Escape characters
echo "This is a line with a newline.\nThis is the second line."

```

# `File permissions` and `Symbolic permissions`
File permissions in Unix-like operating systems control who can access a file or directory and the type of access they have (read, write, execute). Symbolic permissions are a way to represent and modify these permissions using symbols and operators.

File Permissions:
In Unix-like systems, each file or directory has three sets of permissions for three categories of users:

Owner Permissions (rwx):

r (read): Permission to view the contents of the file.
w (write): Permission to modify or delete the file.
x (execute): Permission to execute the file if it is a program or script.
Group Permissions (rwx):

Same as owner permissions but apply to a specific group of users.
Others Permissions (rwx):

Same as owner permissions but apply to all other users.
Symbolic Permissions:
Symbolic permissions use symbols and operators to represent and modify file permissions.
 The basic syntax is:
 chmod [permissions] file

permissions: A combination of symbols and operators.
file: The file or directory whose permissions are being modified.
Symbols:
r (read)
w (write)
x (execute)
Operators:
+ (add a permission)
- (remove a permission)
= (set the permissions explicitly)
```bash
#Add read permission for the group
chmod g+r filename

#Remove execute permission for others
chmod o-x filename

#Set specific permissions
chmod u=rw,go=r filename

#Add execute permission for the owner and group
chmod ug+x filename

```

# `Directory permissions` and `chmod`
Directory permissions in Unix-like operating systems are similar to file permissions but have a few distinctions. Directories use the same permission bits as files (r, w, and x), but their meanings are slightly different:

r (read): Allows listing the contents of the directory.
w (write): Allows creating, deleting, or renaming files within the directory.
x (execute): Allows access to the contents of the directory.
You can use the chmod command to modify directory permissions using symbolic notation:

```bash
#Add read and execute permissions for the owner
chmod u+rx directoryname

#Remove write permission for the group
chmod g-w directoryname

#Set specific permissions for the owner, group, and others
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= directoryname

#Add write and execute permissions for the owner, and read permission for the group and others
chmod u=+wx,g=r,o=r directoryname

```

# `Octal` and `numerical` permissions
In Unix-like operating systems, octal (base-8) notation is another way to represent and set file permissions
. Each permission is assigned a numeric value, and these values are combined to form a three-digit number that represents the permissions for the owner, group, and others.

The numeric values are as follows:

4 corresponds to read (r) permission.
2 corresponds to write (w) permission.
1 corresponds to execute (x) permission.
Octal Permission Values:
4 (read)
2 (write)
1 (execute)

```bash
#Set read and write permissions for the owner, and read-only permissions for the group and others
chmod 644 filename

#Give full permissions to the owner and read-only permissions to the group and others
chmod 744 filename

#Give execute permission to the owner, group, and others
chmod 111 filename
```


# `Which` command
The ` which`  command is used to locate the executable binary file associated with a given command. 
It helps you determine the path of the executable that will be run when you execute a command in the terminal.
 syntax of the which command:
 which command_name

```bash
#example
which ls

#output
/usr/bin/ls
```

# `Whatis` command
The ` Whatis` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to display a brief description of a command or a system call. It provides a short summary or manual page entry related to the specified command.
 the basic syntax:
whatis command_name

```bash
#example
whatis ls

#output
ls (1)               - list directory contents

```

# `Useradd` 
The `useradd` command is a Unix and Linux command-line utility used to create new user accounts on a system. It is commonly used by system administrators to add users to the system and manage user account information.
 the basic syntax of the useradd command:

 It removes the user's entry from the system files, including the password file (/etc/passwd), the shadow password file (/etc/shadow), and other relevant user-related files.
the basic syntax of the userdel command:
sudo userdel [options] username

```bash
#example
sudo userdel john
```

#Always refer to the manual page for userdel (man userdel) for a comprehensive list of options and details about the command.


# `Group management`
Group management in Unix and Linux involves creating, modifying, and deleting groups. 
Groups are used to organize users, allowing them to share common permissions and access to files and resources. The key commands for group management include groupadd, groupdel, and gpasswd.
```bash
# To look at the groups
cat /etc/group

# To add a new group
sudo groupadd groupname

# To delete a group
sudo groupdel groupname

# To add a user to a group
sudo gpasswd -a username groupname
```

# `.bashrc` file
The `.bashrc` file is a script that runs whenever a new interactive Bash shell is started. It is commonly used to customize the behavior of the shell for individual users. Here are some details about the .bashrc file:
Location:
The .bashrc file is typically located in a user's home directory. The file is hidden, which means its name begins with a dot. The full path is usually ~/.bashrc, where ~ represents the user's home directory.
Purpose:
The primary purpose of the .bashrc file is to set up the environment for a user's interactive shell session. This includes defining environment variables, customizing the prompt, and specifying aliases and functions.

```bash
# To look at the file
nano .bashrc

# To edit the file
gedit .bashrc    

# To save  changes after editing the file and, if necessary, apply the changes to the current shell session using:
source ~/.bashrc

Some common ways to run multiple terminal commands sequentially or simultaneously, you can use different methods depending on your requirements. 

Method 1: Sequential Execution using Semicolon (;)
Use a semicolon (;) to separate multiple commands. Commands are executed sequentially, one after the other:
```bash
command1 ; command2 ; command3
```

Method 2: Sequential Execution using Double Ampersand (&&)
Commands are executed sequentially, and the next command runs only if the previous one succeeds (returns exit code 0):
```bash
command1 && command2 && command3
```

Method 3: Sequential Execution using Double Pipe (||)
Commands are executed sequentially, and the next command runs only if the previous one fails (returns a non-zero exit code):
```bash
command1 || command2 || command3
```

Method 4: Running in the Background using Ampersand (&)
To run commands simultaneously in the background, you can use the ampersand (&). The commands will run concurrently:
```bash
command1 & command2 & command3 &
```

Method 5: Running in the Background and Redirecting Output
To run commands in the background and redirect their output to a file:
```bash
(command1 > output1.txt &) ; (command2 > output2.txt &) ; (command3 > output3.txt &)
```

# `apt-get` command
The `apt-get` command is a package management command-line tool in Debian-based systems, including Ubuntu.

```

3. Remove a Package:
To remove a package but keep its configuration files:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove package_name
```

4. To remove a package along with its configuration files:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge package_name
```

5. Upgrade Installed Packages:
To upgrade all installed packages to their latest versions:

```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

6. Dist-Upgrade:

# `tar` command
The `tar` command in Unix and Linux is used for creating, viewing, and extracting archive files. 
It stands for "tape archive" and is commonly used to bundle multiple files and directories into a single archive file. 
Below are  some common use cases for the `tar` command:

1. Create a Tar Archive:
To create a tar archive:

```bash
tar -cvf archive_name.tar file1 file2 directory1
```
- `-c`: Create a new archive.
- `-v`: Verbose mode (display progress).
- `-f`: Specify the archive file name.

2.  Extract Files from a Tar Archive:
To extract files from a tar archive:

```bash
tar -xvf archive_name.tar
```
- `-x`: Extract files from an archive.
- `-v`: Verbose mode (display progress).
- `-f`: Specify the archive file name.

3.  Create a Gzipped Tar Archive:
To create a tar archive and compress it using gzip:

```bash
tar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz file1 file2 directory1
```
- `-z`: Compress the archive using gzip.

4. Extract Files from a Gzipped Tar Archive:
To extract files from a gzipped tar archive:

```bash
tar -xzvf archive_name.tar.gz
```
- `-z`: Decompress the archive using gzip.

5. Create a Bzipped Tar Archive:
To create a tar archive and compress it using bzip2:

```bash
tar -cjvf archive_name.tar.bz2 file1 file2 directory1
```
- `-j`: Compress the archive using bzip2.

6. Extract Files from a Bzipped Tar Archive:
To extract files from a bzipped tar archive:

```bash
tar -xjvf archive_name.tar.bz2
```
- `-j`: Decompress the archive using bzip2.

7. View Contents of an Archive:
To view the contents of a tar archive without extracting:

```bash
tar -tvf archive_name.tar
```
- `-t`: Display the contents of an archive.

8. Additional Options:
- `-C directory`: Change to the specified directory before performing any operations.
- `--exclude=pattern`: Exclude files or directories that match the specified pattern.
- `--directory`: Specify the directory to extract files into.

# `grep` command
The `grep` command in Unix and Linux is used for searching text patterns within files. 
It allows you to match lines in a file that contain a specified pattern. 
```bash

#To search for a pattern in a file:
grep pattern filename
#- `pattern`: The text pattern you want to search for.
#- `filename`: The name of the file to search.

#Search Recursively in Directories:
To search for a pattern in all files within a directory (recursively):

#grep -r pattern directory
- `-r`: Recursively search in subdirectories.

#To perform a case-insensitive search:
grep -i pattern filename
#- `-i`: Ignore case distinctions in patterns.

#To display line numbers along with matching lines:
grep -n pattern filename
#- `-n`: Show line numbers.

#To display only the part of the line that matches the pattern:
grep -o pattern filename
#- `-o`: Show only the matching part.

# Invert Match (Show Non-Matching Lines):
grep -v pattern filenam
#- `-v`: Invert the match.

# Count the Number of Matching Lines:
grep -c pattern filename
#- `-c`: Count.

#Using Regular Expressions:
grep '^word' filename
#- `^`: Anchors the pattern to the beginning of a line.

#To grep for multiple patterns stored in a file:
grep -f patterns.txt filename
#- `-f patterns.txt`: Read patterns from a file.
```

# `netstat`

 command

The `netstat` command in Unix and Linux is used for displaying various networking-related information, including network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships. However, similar to `ifconfig`, `netstat` has been deprecated on many modern Linux distributions, and the recommended replacement is the `ss` command or tools like `ip` and `nstat`. Nevertheless, `netstat` is still available on some systems.

Here are some common use cases for the `netstat` command:

1. Display All Active Network Connections:
To display a list of all active network connections:

```bash
netstat -a
```

2. Display Listening Ports:
To display listening ports and associated programs:

```bash
netstat -l
```

3. Display Network Statistics:
To display network statistics, including incoming and outgoing packets:

```bash
netstat -s
```
